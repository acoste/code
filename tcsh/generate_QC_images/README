This directory contains the scripts I made to generate mosaic images from an original ColorFA input Volume.
The script slice the volume to extract 9 images, and then process them and append them into a mosaic image.

This script is specific to each aquisition protocol and is part of the ColorFA Quality Control Pipeline.

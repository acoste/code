This directory contains a wide range of code I made or modified to process MRI files such as DWI sets, DTI, header or various types of images (2D,3D,4D,9D...).
If the code is not mine I'll give credit to it's authors and links to get it.

The code is developped and used in a LINUX environment (OpenSuse 11.4) and may require some external libraries such as ITK, VTK, OpenGL...

The scripts are written in tcsh, and most of the time use specialized NeuroImaging software such as "unu", "dtiestim" and others. Some of them are available.

The web directory contains some code I used to set an online image viewer.
I did NOT developed it, but I contributed.
